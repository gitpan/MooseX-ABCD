NAME
    MooseX::ABCD - MooseX::ABC, but checking required methods on
    make_immutable

SYNOPSIS
       {
          package Shape;
          use Moose;
          use MooseX::ABCD;
          requires 'draw';
          __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;
       }
   
       {
          package Circle;
          use Moose;
          extends 'Shape';
          sub draw {
             ...;
          }
          __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;
       }
   
       my $shape  = Shape->new;   # dies
       my $circle = Circle->new;  # succeeds
   
       {
          package Square;
          use Moose;
          extends 'Shape';
          __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;
          # ^^^ dies, draw is unimplemented
       }

DESCRIPTION
    What does ABCD stand for? Hmmm... maybe "abstract base classes deferred"?
    or "abstract base classes declare-compatible"? (This module works with
    MooseX::Declare, whereas MooseX::ABC does not!)

    Anyway, whatever ABCD does or does not stand for, this is what
    MooseX::ABCD does: it works just like MooseX::ABC, the checks that derived
    classes implement all abstract methods happen when the class is made
    immutable, not when inheritance is set up.

    Why? It works better with MooseX::Declare this way.

  Functions
    This module exports one function to your namespace:

    `requires`
        Works like `requires` in Moose roles, but for classes.
